### What is .NET

.NET is a general-purpose development platform. It has several key features, such as support for multiple programming languages, asynchronous and concurrent programming models, and native interoperability, which enable a wide range of scenarios across multiple platforms.

Programming Languages Actively Supported by Microsoft:

1. C# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented, while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages.
2. VB.NET is an easy language to learn that you use to build a variety of apps that run on .NET. Among the .NET languages, the syntax of VB is the closest to ordinary human language, often making it easier for people new to software development.
3. F# is a cross-platform, functional-first programming language that also supports traditional object-oriented and imperative programming.

Development Tools:

1. Visual Studio
2. VS Code.

Key Features of .NET:

1. Multiple Programming Language
2. Automatic Memory Management
3. Generics
4. Type Safety
5. LINQ
6. Native Interoperability
7. Async Programming

### Primary .NET Implementations

The Following are **primary .NET implementations** that Microsoft actively develops and maintains:

1. .NET Framework
2. Mono
3. Xamarin
4. .NET Core

**Each implementation of .NET includes the following components:**

- **One or more runtimes.** Examples: CLR for .NET Framework, CoreCLR and CoreRT for .NET Core.
- A class library that implements the **.NET Standard** and may **implement additional APIs.** Examples: .NET Framework Base Class Library, .NET Core Base Class Library.
- Optionally, one or more **application frameworks.**  Examples: ASP.NET, Windows Forms, and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) are included in the .NET Framework.
- Optionally, **development tools.** Some development tools are shared among multiple implementations.

### Types of Applications we can develop in .NET

1. Console Based Applications
2. Windows Application (GUI)
    - WinForms
    - Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
    - UWP - Universal Windows Platform Application
3. Windows Services
4. Web Based Applications
    - Web Forms (ASPX / AMSX)
    - MVC
    - Razor Pages
5. Service Oriented Applications
    - ASP.NET ASMX
    - SOAP Services using Windows Communication Framework (WCF)
    - RESTful Services using WFC and ASP.NET Web API
6. Mobile Applications
    - Xamarin for Native App development for Android, IOS and Windows Phone
    -  Apache Cordova for Hybrid App Development

.NET Runtimes:

A runtime is the execution environment for a managed program. The OS is part of the runtime environment but is not part of the .NET runtime. Here are some examples of .NET runtimes:

- Common Language Runtime (CLR) for the .NET Framework
- Core Common Language Runtime (CoreCLR) for .NET Core
- .NET Native for Universal Windows Platform
- The Mono runtime for Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.Mac, and the Mono desktop framework

.NET Compilers:

- **Roslyn** is a compiler platform and includes the C# and VB compilers and other tools. These compilers emit **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)** code. It provides open-source C# and Visual Basic compilers with rich code analysis APIs. It enables building code analysis tools with the same APIs that are used by Visual Studio. Roslyn produces platform independent Intermediate Language (IL) and is used when building against .NET 2015, including Framework and Core. At release, the entire .NET Framework will be compiled using Roslyn.

- **RyuJIT** is the new default just-in-time (JIT) compiler for .NET on x64. The JIT compiler takes IL and compiles it for the particular machine architecture the first time it is executed at run-time. Used for desktop and server-based scenarios, RyuJIT is an overhaul of the previous 64-bit JIT compiler that significantly reduces startup times. It also includessupport for SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) which allows mathematical operations to execute over a set of values in parallel.

- **.NET Native** compiles C# and VB to native machine code that performs like C++, so developers continue to benefit from the productivity and familiarity of the .NET Framework with the performance of native code. Typically, apps that target .NET are compiled to intermediate language (IL). At run time, the just-in-time (JIT) compiler translates the IL to native code. In contrast, .NET Native is an ahead-of-time compiler that compiles apps directly to native code and contains a minimal CLR runtime. Popular Windows Store apps start up to 60% faster and use 15-20% less memory when compiled with .NET Native. Universal Windows apps will run on .NET Native (ARM, x86, x64). 

### MS.NET Framework Version History

- The first .NET implementation that has existed since 2002.
- Its best optimized for developing Windows desktop applications using WinForms and WPF.
- It supports the largest set of APIs, you’re much less likely to have to worry about whether you can easily accomplish some complex task if you target the .NET Framework.
